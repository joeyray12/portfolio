## Description
This is a portfolio used to show the start of my professional projects, it will also be used as a means to acquire my contact information for any potential employers. This page can be adjusted to fit different screen sizes and will shrink down if the page is also made to be smaller. The navigation bar will direct you to whichever category of the page it is listed as.
